# Custom serving job with specified gpus 


You can use arena to deploy your trained model as RESTful APIs.to illustrate usage,we use a sample project [fast-style-transfer](https://github.com/floydhub/fast-style-transfer).in order to save time,we use its' trainted model and add the model to docker images.

1\. Deploy the serving job

we use the app.py script in project to start restful server,you can use arena to deploy trainted model:

	$ arena serve custom \
		--name=fast-style-transfer \
		--gpus=1 \
		--version=alpha \
		--replicas=1 \
		--restful-port=5000 \
		--image=happy365/fast-style-transfer:latest \
		"python app.py"


check the status of TensorFlow Serving Job:

	$ arena serve list
	NAME                 TYPE    VERSION  DESIRED  AVAILABLE  ENDPOINT_ADDRESS  PORTS
	fast-style-transfer  CUSTOM  alpha    1        0          172.21.8.94       grpc:8001,restful:5000


because the docker image is very large,pulling it requests some time,we can use kubectl to check the pod status:

	$ kubectl get po
	NAME                                                        READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
	fast-style-transfer-alpha-custom-serving-845ffbf7dd-btbhj   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          6m44s


2\. Access the service  

we can use a client to access the service,run the follow command to create a client:

	$ kubectl run  sample-client \
		--generator=run-pod/v1 \
		--image=happy365/arena-serve-custem-sample-client:latest \
		--command -- \
		/bin/sleep infinity


then,we can query the status of sample-client:

	$ kubectl get po  sample-client
	NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
	sample-client   1/1     Running   0          87s 


we should query the sevice name,it is a combination of job name and version(the sample job name is fast-style-transfer and version is alpha):

	$ kubectl get svc fast-style-transfer-alpha
	NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
	fast-style-transfer-alpha   ClusterIP   172.21.1.114   <none>        5000/TCP   31m


now,we can use the ``kubectl exec`` command to login the container:

	$ kubectl exec -ti sample-client /bin/sh


then we use ``curl`` command to access the custom serving job:

	$ curl -o /root/output/beijing_out.jpg  -F "file=@/root/input/beijing.jpg" http://fast-style-transfer-alpha:5000

the input is an image which name is ``beijing.jpg`` and the image is stored in ``/root/input``.

![image](15-custom-serving-sample-beijing.jpg)

the output is  stored in ``/root/output``. you can use ``kubectl cp`` command to copy output image from container to host:

	$ kubectl cp sample-client:/root/output/beijing_out.jpg ~/beijing_out.jpg

now you can view the image in ``~/beijing_out.jpg``.
